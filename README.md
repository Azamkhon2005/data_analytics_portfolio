# AZAMKHON BUZURUKOV 

Hi there! My name is Azamkhon Buzurukov and I am a data analyst in the making. I have always been fascinated by the power of data and how it can be used to drive business decisions and solve complex problems. 

I have been honing my skills in data analysis through various projects. My experience has taught me how to collect, clean, analyze, and visualize data using tools such as Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Redash.
