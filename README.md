# SAIDAZAMKHON BUZURUKOV 

Hi there! My name is Saidazamkhon Buzurukov and I am a data analyst in the making. I have always been fascinated by the power of data and how it can be used to drive business decisions and solve complex problems. 

I have experience working with data: analysis, manipulation, visualization, as well as experience in statistical
analysis and hypothesis testing. Data analysis projects have been completed using tools such as Python, SQL, Tableau, Excel and Redash.

My CV is [here]([https://github.com/Azamkhon2005/data_analytics_portfolio/blob/main/%D0%91%D1%83%D0%B7%D1%83%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BC%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%BD_%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B7%D1%8E%D0%BC%D0%B5.pdf])
