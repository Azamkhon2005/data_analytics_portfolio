# SAIDAZAMKHON BUZURUKOV 

Hi there! My name is Saidazamkhon Buzurukov and I am a data analyst in the making. I have always been fascinated by the power of data and how it can be used to drive business decisions and solve complex problems. 

I have experience working with data: analysis, manipulation, visualization, as well as experience in statistical
analysis and hypothesis testing. Data analysis projects have been completed using tools such as Python, SQL, Tableau, Excel and Redash.
